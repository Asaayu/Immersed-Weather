# Immersed-Weather
This is the scripted version of my Immersed Weather mod.

To install this add the content from description.ext to your description.ext.
Then copy the 'IMW-Snow' folder to your mission root directory.
Then add [] execVM "IMW-Snow/init.sqf" to your mission's init file.
Bada bing, bada boom. Mission complete!
